        <p>Welcome to my Allum1 game!</p><br>
        <p>Allum1 is a game based on matches where you get to play turn by turn against an artificial intelligence (AI).
          Each player can take one to three matches. The looser is the one who takes the last match.</p><br>
        <p>Allum1 is a student project proposed by Coding Academy by Epitech, thanks for their support.</p><br>
        <p>Let's play!</p>
